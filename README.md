# smarty-reader

Read smart Luxembourgish electricity and gaz counter values with ESP8266.

# Deprecation notice

I am not actively maintaining this project any more because I have been unable to fix a recurring issue where the ESP8266 just hangs/disappears. I am considering a re-write in Rust on the ESP32-C3 platform instead as a new challenge.

Update Oct 2022: The original author has just published a [new version of his code](https://github.com/weigu1/SmartyReader/tree/main/Arduino/SmartyReader_P1_WiFi) (1.6) that includes most of the features I need, make sure to check it out.

# Overview

<img src="http://weigu.lu/microcontroller/smartyreader/png/smartyreader_1_800.png"  width="150"/>

In Luxembourg, electricty and gas counters are being replaced with smart counters that allow the provider to remotely measure consumption values. A special port is provided to allow the end-user to capture the data, for example for integration with home automation systems.

This work is a fork of the [awesome project by Guy WEILER](http://www.weigu.lu/microcontroller/smartyReader_P1/index.html) who did all the hard work on both the software and hardware side. Please review [Guy's website](http://www.weigu.lu/microcontroller/smartyReader_P1/index.html) for technical details on the solution, PCB layout, etc.

# Features

- publish all values from the electricity counter to MQTT in their own topic
- units are published as well in a separate topic for easy of interpretation
- if a gas counter is connected to the electricity counter, gas volume is published as well (implemented but not tested yet)
- possibility to work without a counter from a data capture to make quick tests when adding new features
- extensive logging available on the second UART port (the first one is used by the counter)
- supports the smarty firmware as of April 2020 (more data points available, see below)


# Requirements

- A 'smarty' electricity meter
- Your personal decryption key, that you need to ask from the provider Creos, giving them your counter number
- A Wimo D1 mini pro micro-controller and adaptation board. See [Guy's website](http://www.weigu.lu/microcontroller/smartyReader_P1/index.html)

# Usage

- Download and install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/). I did not test it with the Arduino IDE.
- Open the project in PlatformIO
- Copy the file `include/smarty_user_config_sample.h` to `include/smarty_user_config.h` and adjust it to your needs (WiFi settings, decription key, MQTT server).
- Build and program the Wimo
